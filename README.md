# 🧠 Mastering the AI Toolkit – AI Tools & Applications Group Assignment

This repository contains our submission for the **AI Tools & Applications** assignment under the theme **“Mastering the AI Toolkit.”** The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Theoretical Understanding** of AI tools and frameworks.
2. **Practical Implementation** of classical machine learning, deep learning, and NLP tasks using real datasets.
3. **Ethical Reflection & AI Debugging**, focusing on responsible AI practices and code optimization.

We used a variety of powerful AI frameworks — TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy — to showcase our understanding and practical skills.
